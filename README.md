Weather prediction

This project focuses on weather prediction using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. RNNs are particularly well-suited for time series forecasting because they can capture temporal dependencies in sequential data. In this case, the goal is to predict future temperatures based on historical weather data from Seattle. The model is trained to learn patterns in the data, enabling it to make accurate predictions of maximum temperatures. Through this project, we explore the power of deep learning techniques in the domain of weather forecasting, demonstrating how past weather patterns can be leveraged to predict future conditions.
